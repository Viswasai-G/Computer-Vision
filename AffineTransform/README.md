# Affine Transformation


Affine transformation is a linear mapping method that preserves points, straight lines, and planes. Sets of parallel lines remain parallel after an affine transformation. The affine transformation technique is typically used to correct for geometric distortions or deformations that occur with non-ideal camera angles.

Given 2 images that are geometrically distorted, the functions used in this folder perform Affine Transformation on 2 images.
